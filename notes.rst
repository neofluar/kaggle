What
====

ML is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data.

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some perfomance measure P, if its perfomans on T, as measured by P, improves with E.

Why
===

ML is great for:

- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long list of rules;
- Complex problems for which using traditional approach yields no good solution;
- Fluctuating environment: a ML system can adapt to new data;
- Getting insights about complex problems and large amount of data.

Examples of applications:

- Analyzing images of products
- Detecting tumors in brain scans
- Automatically classifying new articles
- Flagging offensive comments
- Summarizing documents
- Creating chatbots
- Forecasting company's revenue
- Voice recognition
- Detecting credit card fraud
- Segmenting clients
- Recommending products
